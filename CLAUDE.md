# Rules

- *NEVER* attempt to use any historically destructive git commands
- *ALWAYS* make small and frequent commits
- This project is using Zig 0.15 and you must respect the available API for that
- All tests must pass, do not ignore failing tests that you believe are unrelated to your work. Only fix those failing tests after you've completed and validated your work. The last step of any job you do should be to ensure all tests pass.
- *NEVER* attempt to launch the Zig documentation, it is a web app that you cannot access. Instead you *MUST* search the documentation on the ziglang website
- *ALWAYS* use Test-Driven Development (TDD): write failing tests first, then implement the code to make them pass
- Run tests with `zig build test`

## Release Process

When the user says "release" (or similar), follow this procedure:

### 1. Determine the version

- If the user specifies a version, use it.
- *MUST* read the current version from `build.zig.zon` first and treat that source-code version as the canonical baseline for the next release. Do not derive the baseline version from git tags, commit messages, or GitHub releases when they disagree with the source tree.
- Do **NOT** bump to `0.1.0` or higher without explicit permission from the user. Continue incrementing `0.0.x` until told otherwise.
- While on `0.0.x`, all changes (features, fixes, everything) are patch bumps.
- If tags or history suggest a higher version than `build.zig.zon`, treat that as drift to be corrected instead of as the next release baseline.

### 2. Update version strings

- `build.zig.zon` — `.version = "X.Y.Z",`

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md

Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):
- Add a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section below `## [Unreleased]` (or below the header if no Unreleased section exists)
- Categorize changes under: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Each entry should be a concise, user-facing description (not a commit message)

### 4. Commit, tag, and push

```sh
git add build.zig.zon CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Release X.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```
